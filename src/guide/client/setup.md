# Setting up the Client

After running the client for the first time you will need to enter settings in order to setup some information about you.
1. You will be required to set a 'nickname' which will be your display name to other clients on the network.
2. You can optionally choose to connect to your simbrief by entering your simbrief username. This will enable automatic flightplan filing each time you connect to UniFly
3. UniFly will have automatically attempted to detect the filepaths of any installed flight simulators on your computer. If it has missed any, in settings you may manually add the filepaths.
4. Under the Servers tab you may want to change which community you're connected to. Bare in mind you won't be able to see players that are not connected to the same server as you.
5. When you're ready, hit Connect on the homepage! After both Network & Simulator are showing green `Connected`, you're good to go. Filing a flightplan is optional but highly recommended.
