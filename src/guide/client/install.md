# Client

The UniFly Client runs on your computer and connects your flight simulator to our network.

## Download the installer
First, download the [installer](https://unifly.gg/#Download) from our website. After installing it, run it and follow through the prompts. After it has finished, UniFly has been installed and will automatically be updated
every time you run it.

# Setting up the Client

After running the client for the first time you will need to enter settings in order to setup some information about you.
1. You will be required to set a 'nickname' which will be your display name to other clients on the network.
2. You can optionally choose to connect to your simbrief by entering your simbrief username. This will allow you to quickly import a flightplan from Simbrief.
3. UniFly will have automatically attempted to detect the filepaths of any installed flight simulators on your computer. Manually add in any that it has missed.
4. When you're ready, enter in the details of your flight and hit connect. When both Network & Simulator are showing green `Connected`, you're good to go
