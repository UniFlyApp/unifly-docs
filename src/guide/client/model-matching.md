# Installing model matching
In order for UniFly to show other pilots in your simulator, you must install a set of aircraft models for them to be shown in. UniFly recommends that you install either the FLAi model set for P3D and FSX, or the FSLTL model set for MSFS.

For advanced users, UniFly offers a model matching ruleset system based on Vatsim's vPilot client ruleset files. UniFly comes installed with rulesets for FLAi, FSLTL and AIG modelsets. If you want to add your own, you can do so in `%appdata%/UniFly/modelmatching/simconnect`
