# (Optional) Installing terrain probe
In order for UniFly to measure ground elevation data it has to spawn in a sim object. By default, UniFly will use a Van SimObject or a Killer Whale SimObject depending on your simulator to do this. These default options aren't ideal and can be distracting and immersion breaking, so UniFly also provides an option to install a completely invisible terrain probe.
