# (Optional) Installing terrain probe

UniFly uses an altitude 'probe' to measure the terrain elevation in your simulator around other players. This is necessary for UniFly to correctly account for variations in terrain elevation from simulator to simulator and scenery to scenery. As a result, by default, UniFly may spawn a visible default ground service Van model (For MSFS) or even a dolphin (for P3D) at the location of other players in order to do this. This is distracting so you may wish to perform this additional optional step to allow UniFly to use a transparent model instead.


## MSFS
For MSFS you will need to copy the `UniFlyTerrainProbe` folder into your MSFS community folder. The terrain probe can be found inside your UniFly installation (by default: `%localappdata%/unifly/`)

## P3D
Work in progress. Please contact support on Discord
