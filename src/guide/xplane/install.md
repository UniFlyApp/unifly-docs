# Installing the UniFly XPlane plugin/adapter

## Installing the plugin
The XPlane plugin allows the UniFly client to communicate with the XPlane simulator. It should be installed inside `X-Plane 11/Resources/plugins/`.

## Installing modelmatching
The xplane plugin is built ontop of `XPMP2`, the same open source piece of software atop which the xplane vatsim client xPilot is built. Therefore any models which work for xPilot will work with UniFly, and their installation is similar. Models should be placed inside of `X-Plane 11/Resources/plugins/UniFly-XPLM/Resources/CSL`. Bluebell models are recommended.
