# Setting up EuroScope from scratch

## Install EuroScope
First, install EuroScope from the [official website](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/installation/). Follow through the installer.

## Downloading sector files
You must download sector files to tell EuroScope the up to date layout of airspaces and airports for which you want to control. See EuroScope's own documentation for further details.

You can find sector files for most airspaces on the [AeroNav](https://files.aero-nav.com/) website.

When you open EuroScope, it will prompt you to select the sector file profile for the airspace you want to control. Simply select the .prf file for the airspace you just downloaded, and you should be good to go.

Now that EuroScope is setup, see the next page for a guide on how to connect EuroScope to UniFly.
