## Simulated Weather
For best results in terms of UniFly's ability to match your cruising flight levels, please use Real Weather on the UniFly network.

In MSFS2024, selecting non-real time will also select non-real weather, which does result in altitude mismatch on UniFly. Please use real time and real weather.

## Development & Funding
UniFly's costs are entirely funded by donators and our own staff team. If you'd like to become one of our appreciated donators, please join our discord for a full rundown on our operating costs.

UniFly's development is fronted by a voluntary team working to serve the community and their passion. Whilst UniFly is a closed source project, we're always looking to bring on new developers to the team.
