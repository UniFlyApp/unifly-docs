## Development & Funding
UniFly's costs are entirely funded by donators and our own staff team. If you'd like to become one of our appreciated donators, please join our discord for a full rundown on our operating costs.

UniFly's development is fronted by a voluntary team working to serve the community and their passion. Whilst UniFly is a closed source project, we're always looking to bring on new developers to the team.
